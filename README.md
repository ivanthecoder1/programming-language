# Proto Language 
**The goal of this project is to create a prototype of a programming language in Rust. Following along with the Crafting Interpreters book**

The following features needed to create a programming language (More features to be added):

- [X] **Lexer: Convert program source code into tokens that represent important information such as alphabets or keywords: false, return, true, etc**
- [X] **Parser: Convert token stream into an abstract syntax tree or AST. Consume tokens that match the grammar, otherwise leave them alone**
- [X] **Interpreter: Reads nodes and executes code, translating and executing it line by line**


Technologies: Rust, Noms library, Crates
