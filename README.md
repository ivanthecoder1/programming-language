# Proto Language 
**Created a basic prototype of a programming language in Rust. Followed along with the Crafting Interpreters book**

Features
- **Lexer: Convert program source code into tokens that represent important information such as alphabets or keywords: false, return, true, etc**
- **Parser: Convert token stream into an abstract syntax tree or AST. Consume tokens that match the grammar, otherwise leave them alone**
- **Interpreter: Reads nodes and executes code, translating and executing it line by line**
- **Testcases to test features above


Technologies: Rust, Noms library, Crates
